# Traffic_Sign_Detection_and_Recognition

A Real Time Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition Tool. 

To actually run this code, you have to vist my google drive and then there is a folder called YOLO in which you just have to run the cells from the beginning. THe ipynb files present here cannot be executed because it requires annotations, datasets and trained weights and all of these things are big enough in size that they can't be uploaded on the github.
